Here I carried out Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Nigeria Business Funding Data to prepare it for model training
Steps:
1. Import dependencies (pandas, numpy, LabelEncoder from sklearn)
2. Import data to the working environment and inspect
3. Carry out data clearning
4. Handle missing values
5. Carry out label encoding on categorical data
